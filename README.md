During Counter-Strike Major Championships, players can participate in a Pick'em challenge. For the group stages, the player must pick the two teams that qualify 3-0, the six teams that qualify 3-1 or 3-2, and the two teams that finish 0-3. 
This program calculates each team's probability of qualifying from a given group stage, as well as going 3-0 or 0-3, by simulating the Swiss-system tournament using HLTV's team ranking points to compare teams. 
The first matchups in every simulation are predetermined as they are seeded beforehand.
